### 🚫 FORBIDDEN PATHS - NEVER ACCESS THESE

| Path | Why Forbidden |
| ---- | ------------- |
| `C:\Projects\SPFx\RecruitmentManager\` | Parent folder - contains unrelated projects |
| `C:\Projects\SPFx\RecruitmentManager\recruitment-manager\` | Separate Recruitment Manager app |
| `C:\Projects\SPFx\jml-lite\` | Outdated/different copy - NOT our project |

**If the user asks you to reference another project for comparison, they will EXPLICITLY tell you.**

## Development Guidelines

### SCSS Rules (CRITICAL)
1. NEVER create `.module.css` files — use `.module.scss` only
2. Always use `:global()` for Fluent UI class selectors
3. Always use `!important` for Fluent UI v9 border overrides
4. DialogBody needs `display: flex` override for custom footers
5. Panel headers need `.ms-Panel-headerText { display: none }` override

### Services
1. Use the singleton SPFI instance via `getSP()`
2. Use `JML_LISTS` constants for all list names
3. Audit logging is fire-and-forget (never throws)
4. PnP/SP v3: Use `Promise.all()` for batch operations (no `createBatch`)

### PowerShell Scripts

1. **Do NOT include `Connect-PnPOnline` or `Disconnect-PnPOnline`** in scripts — the user will already be connected to the SharePoint site before running any scripts
2. Scripts assume the PnP PowerShell context is already established
3. Focus on the actual operations (list creation, field provisioning, etc.)

### Role Hierarchy
- **User** (Level 0): Dashboard, My Onboarding, Search, Help
- **Manager** (Level 1): + Onboarding, Transfers, Offboarding, Approvals, Analytics
- **Admin** (Level 2): + Admin Center

SP Groups: `JML Admin`, `JML Manager`

## Session Recovery Guide (For New Claude Agents)

When starting a new session and the user says "continue" or "pick up where we left off":

### Step 1: Check Session State Above

The "Session State" section contains current work status, known issues, and pending features.

### Step 2: Ask the User These Questions

1. **Which component were you working on?** (e.g., OnboardingWizard, MoverTracker, Dashboard)
2. **What specific task needs to be done?** (e.g., "fix validation on step 3", "add new field")
3. **What's currently broken or incomplete?** (e.g., "form doesn't save", "styling is wrong")

### Step 3: Read Relevant Files

Don't ask the user to explain code - read the files directly:

```text
Key entry points:
- src/webparts/dwxJmlLite/DwxJmlLiteWebPart.ts (main webpart)
- src/webparts/dwxJmlLite/components/DwxJmlLite.tsx (main router)
- src/webparts/dwxJmlLite/components/JML/ (all JML components)
- src/webparts/dwxJmlLite/services/ (all services)
```

### Tips for Efficient Context Building

- **Don't ask users to paste large code blocks** - read files yourself
- **Don't attach large images** - keep mockups under 1MB or describe in text
- **Keep prompts focused** - "fix X in Y file" is better than long explanations
- **Use this CLAUDE.md** - it has the full architecture and conventions

### Quick Commands for Context

```bash
# See project structure
ls -la C:/Projects/SPFx/RecruitmentManager/jml-lite/src/webparts/dwxJmlLite/components/JML/

# Check recent changes
cd C:/Projects/SPFx/RecruitmentManager/jml-lite && git log --oneline -10

# Find a component
grep -r "ComponentName" C:/Projects/SPFx/RecruitmentManager/jml-lite/src/
```

## Common Errors & Fixes

### SCSS/Styling Issues

| Problem | Solution |
| ------- | -------- |
| Fluent UI styles not applying | Use `:global(.ms-ClassName)` wrapper |
| Fluent v9 borders not overriding | Add `!important` to border properties |
| Panel header showing | Add `.ms-Panel-headerText { display: none }` |
| DialogBody layout broken | Add `display: flex` override |
| Module CSS not found | NEVER use `.module.css` - always `.module.scss` |

### PnP/SP Issues

| Problem | Solution |
| ------- | -------- |
| Batch operations fail | PnP v3 removed `createBatch()` - use `Promise.all()` |
| SPFI not initialized | Call `getSP()` singleton, ensure context passed |
| List not found | Check `JML_LISTS` constants match actual list names |

### Build Issues

| Problem | Solution |
| ------- | -------- |
| TypeScript errors on build | Run `gulp clean` first, then rebuild |
| Package won't deploy | Check `sharepoint/solution/` for `.sppkg` file |
| "Module not found" | Check import paths use correct casing |
